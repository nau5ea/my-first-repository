a first exploration of github and computation

i want to design music software that's intuitive, simple, user-friendly, etc.
i love ableton live.

i am here to learn the essential skills of software programming and composition that will enable me to work in the audio software industry, and then to use those tools in a design process whose products allow intuitive user operation.
